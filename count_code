Return the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in the given string, except we'll accept any letter for the 'd', so "cope" and "cooe" count.

count_code('aaacodebbb') → 1
count_code('codexxcode') → 2
count_code('cozexxcope') → 2

def count_code(str):
  cnt=0
  
  for i in range(len(str)-3):
    if str[i]+str[i+1]+str[i+3]=='coe':
      cnt=cnt+1
      
  return cnt
